# Sustainable-Traveling
This repository is a part of a group assingment for a course in sustainable development (ENM156) given at Chalmers University of Technology.

The android application is bringing changes to a Västrafik ToGo application clone. The application was developed with permission and in cooperation with Västrafik to propose changes to their application to allow public transport in Gothenburg to become more sustainable.

The application is developed as an answer to two challenges stated by västtrafik:
  - How can we get travelers to travel more sustainable?
  - How can we get more travelers to use the ferries instead of buses and trams?

The application is a fully functioning travel planner using ResRobot route planning API: https://www.trafiklab.se/api/trafiklab-apis/resrobot-v2/route-planner/
